# DomainLogger
This logs every 100 domain(s) on FreeDNS and sends it towards your console
# Can't you just Ctrl+A?
Yeah, this is just if you want it neatly copied. Just something I made because i was bored
# How do I use this?
1. Run this in your console or as a bookmarklet:
```js
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azvvl/DomainLogger/main/source.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))
```
